This project contains friend and follower lists of various white nationalists, white supremacists, and users seen frequently within their network.

Lists were pulled using tools from [TweetBeaver](https://tweetbeaver.com) and all data was publicly available on user profiles as of February 2023.

Note: TweetBeaver's friend and follower lists tools had a hard limit of 10k friends or followers, and due to this limitation may be incomplete.
