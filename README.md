[![Fash & Friends Twitter Files](https://github.com/LateNightAFA/fashandfriends/blob/main/img/fnf-img.png)](https://github.com/LateNightAFA/fashandfriends/tree/main/data)

This project contains friend lists, follower lists, and timelines of various white nationalists and users seen frequently within their network.

Lists were pulled using tools from [TweetBeaver](https://tweetbeaver.com) and all data was publicly available on user profiles as of February 2023.

Note: TweetBeaver's friend and follower lists tools had a limit of about 10k friends or followers, and due to this and other API limitations the data may be incomplete.
